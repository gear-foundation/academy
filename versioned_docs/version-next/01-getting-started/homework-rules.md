We provide a range of homework assignments. You'll begin with stimulating quizzes and then progress to exciting programming tasks.

For each completed assignment, you'll receive points and a chance to own a distinctive NFT from our exclusive collection.

The programming assignments adhere to specific guidelines, as highlighted below, for GitHub repositories, names, pull requests (PR), reviews and regular homework.

Guidelines for assignments:

- Before completing the first homework you **should** fork the template repository: <https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps-template-gear-academy>
- Configure the repository to **allow** GitHub Pages from Actions: <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow>
- Your repository name **should** include the `-gear-academy` suffix, for example, `myname-gear-academy`.
- Exclude **build artifacts** such as `node_modules`, `target`, and editor files from the repository.
- Sync your fork with the upstream repository before starting each homework.
- Place each homework inside a folder named after the corresponding block, such as `01-tamagotchi`, `02-tamagotchi-interaction`, `03-tamagotchi-nft`, etc.
- **Submit** each homework as a separate pull request (PR) from a feature branch derived from the `master` or another working branch.
- **Don't** submit multiple homework assignments in a single PR.
- **Don't include** any unrelated changes in the PR.
- If any changes are requested, make updates **within the existing branch and PR**.
- Each PR **should** be merged to the `master` after the homework is accepted.
- **Do not** include any scaffolding code, private keys, or passwords in the PR.
- Ensure the tests and build process **pass** successfully;
- You **may** use `git` from the command line instead of relying on the GitHub web interface.
